A collection of resources to setup a multi WAN aggregator, in a similiar fashion to OpenMPTCPRouter, but without all the unnecessary stuff.
#Why

OpenMPTCPRouter is heavily bloated, officially supported only by a handful of devices and its size makes it impossible to install it on some devices with a small flash.

#How

##VPS
1. Download the script
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/somegenericdev/debloated-mptcp/main/vps/script.sh`

2. Set the password
`nano script.sh`

3. Make it executable
`chmod +x script.sh`

4. Run it
`./script.sh`

##Gateway
1. Compile OpenWrt with MPTCP kernel for your device ([follow arinc9's guide](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/tutorial-build-openwrt-with-multipath-tcp/84325))

2. Install v2ray (at compile time or later)

3. Download the script
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/somegenericdev/debloated-mptcp/main/gateway/script.sh`

4. Set the variables (make sure that the executable's path is correct!)
`nano script.sh`

5. Make it executable
`chmod +x script.sh`

6. Run it
`./script.sh`

7. Reboot, then add all the routes in the routing table with 'route add'
